# Why
For people who struggle to start in data analysis with Python

# Description
This hands-on in-person workshop is based on 
[Data Analysis with Python Course by IBM Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-analysis-python/)


Learn how to analyze data using multi-dimensional arrays in NumPy and manipulate DataFrames in pandas using Jupyter-based environment.

# Prerequisite
- [Python for Data Science Workshop](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/pyds)

# Pre-workshop 

You will need a laptop that can access the internet 

## 1: Installation
Install miniconda or install the (larger) Anaconda distribution

[Install Python 3.7 using Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

OR [Install Python 3.7 using Ananconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

## 2: Setup

### 2.1: Download workshop code & materials
Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:aymanibrahim/dapy.git
```
OR [Download the repository as a .zip file](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/dapy/archive/master.zip)

### 2.2: Change directory to pyds
Change current directory to **dapy** directory
```
cd dapy
```
### 2.3: Install Python with required packages
Install Python 3.7 with the required packages into an environment named _dapy_  as per [environment.yml](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/dapy/blob/master/environment.yml) YAML file.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
When conda asks if you want to proceed, type "y" and press Enter.

## 3: Activate environment
Change the current default environment (_base_) into _dapy_ environment.
```
conda activate dapy
```

## 4: Install & Enable ipywidgets extentions

Enable ipywidgets Jupyter Notebook extension

```
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
jupyter nbextension enable python-markdown/main

# Notebooks w/ extensions that auto-run code must be "trusted" to work the first time
jupyter trust ./notebooks/05_Model_Evaluation.ipynb
```

Install ipywidgets JupyterLab extension
```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```

Enable  widgetsnbextension
```
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
```


## 5: Check installation
Use [check_environment.py](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/dapy/blob/master/check_environment.py) script to make sure everything was installed correctly, open a terminal, and change its directory (cd) so that your working directory is the workshop directory _dapy_ you cloned or downloaded. Then enter the following:
```
python check_environment.py
```
If everything is OK, you will get the following message:
> Your workshop environment is set up

## 6: Start JupyterLab
Start JupyterLab using:
```
jupyter lab
```
JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.

You may access JupyterLab by entering the notebook serverâ€™s URL into the browser.

## 7: Stop JupyterLab
Press **CTRL + C** in the terminal to stop JupyterLab.

## 8: Deactivate environment
Change the current environment (_dapy_) into the previous environment.
```
conda deactivate
```
